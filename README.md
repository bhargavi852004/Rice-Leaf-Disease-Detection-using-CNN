# Rice-Leaf-Disease-Detection-using-CNN
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting rice leaf diseases. Users can upload images, and the model provides real-time predictions of the disease class along with raw prediction scores. Built using TensorFlow and Streamlit, it aims to assist farmers and agricultural specialists in managing plant health.
